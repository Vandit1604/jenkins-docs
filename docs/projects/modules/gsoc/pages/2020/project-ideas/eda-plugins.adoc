= Plugin(s) for Electronic Design Automation tools 

*Project goal:* Create a new Jenkins plugin for one of widely used EDA tools

*Skills to study/improve:* Java, EDA Tools

== Details

The idea is to create a Jenkins plugin or a xref:user-docs:pipeline:shared-libraries.adoc[Pipeline Shared library] for one of widely used EDA tools.
Both ASIC or FPGA design flow are acceptable, the tool should be proposed by the potential student.
Open-source EDA tools would be preferable (e.g. Yosys, FuseSoC, ArachnePnR, icetools), but we also consider
conditionally-free tools (like FPGA design EDAs).

Examples of tool integration:

* Tool launch and publishing steps for Free-style and/or Pipeline jobs
* Integration with {plugin}warnings-ng[Warnings Next Generation Plugin] for analysis report parsing.
* Integration with {plugin}xunit[xUnit Plugin] for test results parsing
* Reporting of FPGA resource utilization (per build + trends)
* Timing report trend publishing
* Integrating UVM reports into Jenkins build and project pages

## Special requirements

In the case of FPGA tools integration, a prototyping board will be required unless the project can be done in simulation tools only.

== Quick Start

The main objective for an applicant is to select EDA tools for the project.
An applicant is expected to define a list of tools for a project and to come up with some automation use-cases which could be implemented in a Jenkins.

Recommended steps:

1. Explore a tool, review its automation capabilities (availability of command-line interfaces or API)
2. Try running demos for a tool to explore it
3. Try automating the demos in Jenkins using existing tools and plugins. Jenkins Pipeline is recommended
4. Explore ways to improve the user experience by a plugin (tool management, configuration, reporting, etc.)

Project applications may benefit from some prototype implementations  

== Newbie-friendly issues

Currently there are only few relevant plugins in the Jenkins project.
It is recommended to focus on generic newbie-friendly issues related to tool management and integrations in Jenkins.
