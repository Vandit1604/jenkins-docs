= GitHub Checks API for Jenkins Plugins

*Project Goal:* Create a new plugin API so that plugins can publish GitHub checks status messages

*Skills to study/improve:* Java, REST API, GitHub

== Details

Many projects use pull requests (in GitHub) or similar concepts (in GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) in their development process.
Typically, those pull requests are automatically built and verified with Jenkins. For each build of such a pull request
Jenkins creates several reports that can be analyzed in corresponding Jenkins view: compile errors, test results,
static analysis reports, code and mutation coverage, API contracts violations, etc.

Currently, GitHub shows only the overall status of a Jenkins build in such a pull request: i.e., you will see whether
a build is successful or not, but you will not see why a build has failed. In order to see the details you need to
navigate to the corresponding Jenkins views. It would improve the user experience if Jenkins would directly report
detailed build results in a GitHub pull request using the Checks API. Then developers directly will see in the pull
request view of GitHub what kind of problem failed a build.

Possible milestones for this project are:

- Provide a basic implementation of the GitHub Checks API in a new Jenkins Plugin
- Use this API from Jenkins Warnings plugin to report new Warnings in a pull request
- Define a general API for pull requests and similar concepts (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Use this API from other Jenkins plugins like code coverage, etc.
- Add a low-level Pipeline step which allows reporting to Checks API

== Quickstart

Before exploring the Jenkins features, it would make sense to familiarize yourself with GitHub Checks API.

- https://github.blog/2018-05-07-introducing-checks-api/[Checks API introduction]
- https://github.com/marketplace/category/checks-api[GitHub Apps with Checks API integration] - you may want to try some of them
- https://developer.github.com/apps/quickstart-guides/creating-ci-tests-with-the-checks-api/[Creating CI tests with Checks API]

This project is about implementing the GitHub API and using it in one or more consumers. So it makes sense to look
into two different set of existing plugins:

Possible API

- https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-api[GitHub API]

Possible consumers of the API

- https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-branch-source-plugin[GitHub Branch Source Plugin]
- https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin[Jenkins Warnings Plugin - Next Generation]
- https://plugins.jenkins.io/code-coverage-api[Code Coverage API]

Development Environment for the Warnings Plugin:

== Newbie-friendly issues

Consider implementing a fix for one of the following issues:

Warnings Plugin:

GitHub API, GItHub Branch Source:

- TBD
