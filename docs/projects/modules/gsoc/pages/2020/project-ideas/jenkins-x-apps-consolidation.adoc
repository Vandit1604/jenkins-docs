= Jenkins X: Consolidate the use of Apps / Addons

*Project goal:* Consolidate Apps and Addons inside Jenkins X

*Skills to study/improve:* Go, Kubernetes

== Background

Find out more about the Jenkins X project here: https://jenkins-x.io/

This proposal tries to conslidate Apps and Addons inside Jenkins X to avoid confusion.

Two years ago we added the addon framework to Jenkins X as a way of extending the Jenkins X platform to provide additional capabilities. 

=== We created Addons

 
`Addons` were either generic helm charts or a combination of helm chart plus some custom go code to install and integrate them with the Jenkins X platform.

At this point we referred to `apps` as the charts developers created. e.g. the output of `jx create quickstart` was an app and `jx get apps` would list the quickstarts folks had added to `Staging` or `Production`.

=== We created Apps 

We wanted to avoid having to change the `jx` binary to add a new extension to the Jenkins X platform; so we then introduced the `Apps` framework which provided a more generic way of adding charts chatting to Jenkins X such that anybody could create an app without having to modify the underlying `jx` code.
 

=== Confusion

That's now left us with confusing over what an App is.

This is made worse by having support for `apps` and `addons` in the current CLI.

Developers like to talk about the `apps` they are developing. 


== Proposal

Going forward lets refer to everything as an `App` and deprecate the use of the word `Addon`. 

Then all of these things would be an `App`:

* system charts like knative, gloo, nginx-controller, flagger, prometheus, external-dns, cert-manager
* instantiations of Quickstarts or repositories that folks import

== Implementation

We would be able to reuse the current `jx add app` and `jx delete app` commands and folks could reuse them to add any app to any environment `dev`, `Staging` or `Production`.

One possible confusion is between `jx promote` and `jx add app`. In many ways `promote` is for promoting a different version to a different environment; `jx add app` adds an app to the current environment (usually `Dev` by default).

== Newbie Friendly issues

The Jenkins X issue tracker is located in github. We also provide a list of issues that are good first issues for people looking to contribute to the project: https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/labels/good%20first%20issue

We welcome your contributions.
