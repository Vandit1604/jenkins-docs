= Jenkins REST Plugin 

*Project goal:* Create a new plugin to give Jenkins users the ability to make calls to other Jenkins instances via their REST API

*Skills to study/improve:* Java, REST API, Jenkins Pipeline

NOTE: This idea is published as a draft under active discussion, but it is confirmed in principle. It is FINE to apply to it. The scope and the suggested implementation may change significantly before the final version is published. Sections like quickstart guide and newbie-friendly issues may be also missing. As a contributor, you are welcome to request additional information and to join the discussions using channels linked on this page.

== Project Idea

A Jenkins plugin to wrap the https://github.com/cdancy/jenkins-rest library, allowing Pipeline scripts to interact easily with other (or the self) Jenkins instances via the Jenkins REST API, and eliminating the need to parse responses, making pipeline scripts more concise.

Note: there are other java libraries for the Jenkins REST. The author of this proposal was only familiar with the aforementioned library. There is another library called the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/java-client-api[java client api], hosted in jenkins, which could also be used. The student is expected to compare these libraries and make a recommendation prior to starting the work.

This proposal is not about filling gaps in the Jenkins DSL.

From the Jenkins Pipeline DSL, we can call the link:/doc/pipeline/steps/http_request/[http request plugin] to talk to other services. But this plugin does not “understand” the responses, it simply returns the header and the body of the response to the user. It is up to the user to parse the JSON and extract the relevant pieces.

Interestingly, Jenkins itself has a REST API, so a Pipeline DSL could use the link:/doc/pipeline/steps/http_request/[http request plugin] to talk to the master Jenkins instance from an agent. But the user still to parse the response.

An object oriented approach, leveraging an existing library that parses the responses into objects would be easier for the user.

As explained in the link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/x-EbjnWcFqs[mailing list], it is essential for build steps to return only simple data types, like string, integers, lists of simple data types, maps of simple data types. Steps cannot return methods, nor objects with behaviors. Also, using the GlobalVariable is link:https://javadoc.jenkins.io/plugin/workflow-cps/org/jenkinsci/plugins/workflow/cps/GlobalVariable.html[not recommended], however it might be inevitable. The student is expected to study the use of GlobalVariable in plugins that use it and ask for guidance on the Pipeline Authoring SIG gitter chat on this matter. The student should study the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-workflow-plugin[docker pipeline plugin] source code and the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-workflow-plugin[pipeline loader plugin] to understand.

In the following, we show how the finished plugin would look like from the user point of view in a Jenkins Pipeline DSL program. This is not a specification, it is only an example. The student is expected to study the the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-workflow-plugin[jenkins-rest] library, the Jenkins Plugin tutorials and the Scripted Pipeline syntax, and propose a proper Jenkins Pipeline DSL syntax for this project.

== Quick start

There are many technologies to use together to form this plugin. The student who wishes to get started will need to:

* Try out Jenkins REST APIs
* Try writing a small client using one of REST API Client libraries
* study plugin tutorials on how to write a Pipeline Step plugin
  - Tutorials listed on the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-workflow-plugin[student information page]
  - link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-workflow-plugin[Writing Pipeline compatible plugins]
  - link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-step-api-plugin/blob/master/README.md[Writing Pipeline steps]
  - link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-step-api-plugin/blob/master/README.md[Updating plugin for Pipeline]
  - looking at existing pipeline compatible plugins will be very useful. Example:
      ** link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-step-api-plugin/blob/master/README.md[External Workspace Manager] (look at the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-step-api-plugin/blob/master/README.md[steps folder], the steps themselves, and their execution classes)
* study the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-step-api-plugin/blob/master/README.md[jenkins-rest] library, try the examples in the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-step-api-plugin/blob/master/README.md[wiki]
* create a basic custom pipeline compatible plugin and load it in Jenkins (see the plugin tutorials)
