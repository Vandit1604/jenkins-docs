This page aggregates project ideas for Google Summer of Code 2021. See more information about this project and applications on the xref:gsoc:index.adoc[Jenkins Google Summer of Code page].

Below you can find project ideas which have been proposed for this year. New ideas may be proposed by interested mentors or students (e.g. new features in the core, "write a plugin for MY_TOOL_OR_SERVICE", etc.). Project ideas without potential mentors will be considered though applicants may need to work with the community and GSoC org admins to find mentors. To add a new project idea, see: xref:gsoc:proposing-project-ideas.adoc[proposing project ideas].

== Accepted ideas 

Below you can see the list of project ideas that fully match the Jenkins' project idea standard. The scope of these ideas is well known and we don't normally expect deep changes. All ideas have quick start guidelines and newbie-friendly issues referenced. We welcome contributors to join the mentor teams, and we invite students to submit project proposal applications in relation to these ideas.
