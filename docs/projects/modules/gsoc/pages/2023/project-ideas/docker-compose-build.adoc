== Details
=== Background

We already have a xref:user-docs:installing-jenkins:docker.adoc[section] dedicated to docker in the documentation, but it's too difficult to use for beginners, and even too complex to begin with. 
We need to provide a simple way to get started with Jenkins and Docker.

We could have a set of `docker-compose` files representing various types of Jenkins instances (simple Docker, Kubernetes, …).

These examples would be described in the documentation, and would also (*and that’s the main point*) be tested every week thanks to ci.jenkins.io so that we know they are still working.

As the documentation is using link:https://asciidoc.org/[`asciidoc`] we could use the link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/include-uri/[Include Content by URI] feature to have an up-to-date documentation when it comes to code snippets and at the same time, have link:https://ci.jenkins.io[`ci.jenkins.io`] test these same code snippets.

Of course, these snippets could also be run thanks to link:https://www.gitpod.io/[GitPod].

=== Quick Start

* link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Install Docker Compose]
* Clone a link:https://github.com/gounthar/MyFirstAndroidAppBuiltByJenkins[repo] that already uses docker-compose for Jenkins.
* Run `docker-compose up` and wait for the Jenkins instance to be up and running.
* Study the `docker-compose.yml` file to understand what it does.

=== Skills to Study and Improve

* link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose]
* link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/[Docker Compose file format v3]
* xref:projects:jcasc:index.adoc[Jenkins Configuration as Code]
* link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-dsl/[Job DSL]
* xref:user-docs:installing-jenkins:kubernetes.adoc[Kubernetes]

=== Project Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate

=== Project Size

175 hours

=== Expected outcomes

* A set of docker-compose files that can be used to get started with Jenkins and Docker or Kubernetes on Windows, Linux, macOs, Vagrant and GitPod.
* The documentation that describes how to use these docker-compose files.
* A link:https://ci.jenkins.io[`ci.jenkins.io`] job that tests these docker-compose files every week.
