*Project goal:* To automate screenshot capture process for Jenkins docs

*Skills to study/improve:* Web Browser Automation, Image Comparison

== Details 
=== Background

* Browser automation is a known thing and is an interesting idea to explore for the Jenkins project
* Basic idea is to convert the steps from a human-readable format to a set of computer operations
* This idea is relatively light-weight and is expected to require no more than a few months' time to complete
* Could be in almost any language, it is a separate dev tool

=== Project details

* May be extended to render a series of screenshots assembled as gif or mp4
* How would we define the steps needed?
    - A YAML format to describe the steps
    - Capybara in Ruby expresses UI automation in English phrasing
* How to reduce images to the relevant portion could also be considered
    - Focusing on an element is a known Javascript technique
    - Reducing image size is a more complicated procedure, but feasible

=== Newbie-friendly issues

Any relevant issue to acquire the GSoC contributor with the way documentation is handled in the Jenkins ecosystem, especially the ones in link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/issues/[the jenkins.io repo].

=== Tools available in this space

* Selenium (for web browser automation)
* Capybara (for web browser automation)
* Puppeteer (for webdriver web browser automation)
* Cypress (for webdriver web browser automation)
* Zika (for image comparison)

=== Skills to improve/study

* Web browser automation
* Automatic image comparison

=== Project Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate

=== Project Size

175 hours

=== Expected outcomes

New tool to maintain documentation screenshots

Documentation screenshots will be updated automatically based on steps defined as code.
The steps will be a small domain-specific language that describe common Jenkins UI operations in a way that documentation writers understand.
