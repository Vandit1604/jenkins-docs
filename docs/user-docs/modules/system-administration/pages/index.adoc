= System Administration

This chapter for system administrators of Jenkins servers and nodes. It will
cover system maintenance topics including security, monitoring, and backup/restore.

Users not involved with system-level tasks will find this chapter of limited use.
Individual sections may assume knowledge of information
from previous sections, but such assumptions will be explicitly called out and cross-referenced.

If you are a Jenkins administrator and want to know more about managing Jenkins nodes and instances, see
xref:managing:index.adoc[Managing Jenkins].

For an overview of content in the Jenkins User Handbook, see
