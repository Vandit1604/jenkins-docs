= Using environment variables

Environment variables can be set globally, like the example below, or per
stage. As you might expect, setting environment variables per stage means they
will only apply to the stage in which they're defined.


[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent {
        label '!windows'
    }

    environment {
        DISABLE_AUTH = 'true'

        DB_ENGINE    = 'sqlite'

    }

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo "Database engine is ${DB_ENGINE}"
                echo "DISABLE_AUTH is ${DISABLE_AUTH}"
                sh 'printenv'
            }
        }
    }
}
// Scripted //
node('!windows') {
    withEnv(['DISABLE_AUTH=true',
             'DB_ENGINE=sqlite']) {
        stage('Build') {
            echo "Database engine is ${DB_ENGINE}"
            echo "DISABLE_AUTH is ${DISABLE_AUTH}"
            sh 'printenv'
        }
    }
}

This approach to defining environment variables from within the `Jenkinsfile`
can be very useful for instructing scripts, such as a `Makefile`, to configure
the build or tests differently to run them inside of Jenkins.

See *xref:user-docs:pipeline:jenkinsfile.adoc#using-environment-variables["Using Environment Variables"]* for more details on using environment variables in Pipelines.

Environment variables may also be set by Jenkins plugins.
Refer to the documentation of the specific plugins for environment variable names and descriptions for those plugins.

Another common use for environment variables is to set or override "dummy"
credentials in build or test scripts. Because it's (_obviously_) a bad idea to
put credentials directly into a `Jenkinsfile`, Jenkins Pipeline allows users to quickly
and safely access pre-defined credentials in the `Jenkinsfile` without ever
needing to know their values.

=== Credentials in the Environment

See xref:user-docs:pipeline:jenkinsfile.adoc#handling-credentials[Handling
credentials] in the xref:user-docs:ROOT:index.adoc[User Handbook] for more information.
