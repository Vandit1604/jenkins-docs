= Jenkins Governance Meeting

As per the Jenkins xref:governance-meeting:index.adoc[Governance Document], the community holds a regular governance meeting.
This meeting is used to make decisions about the project: budget approvals, key decisions sign-off, voting on proposals if there is no consensus, etc.
It is open for everyone to participate and vote.
The topics are usually discussed in the link:https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev[developer mailing list] ahead of the meeting,
so contributors can share their feedback and cast votes asynchronously.

This meeting is rarely used for technical decisions, for that purpose we use the developer mailing list and link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/[Jenkins Enhancement Proposals].
If a decision cannot be made at the governance meeting, the project's xref:project:ROOT:board.adoc[governance board] takes priority.

=== How to join the meetings?

The governance meeting commonly happens every two weeks on Mondays, see the link:/events[event calendar] for exact times and subscription.
We hold the meeting as a recorded video call.
The meetings calendar with links is available xref:events:ROOT:index.adoc[here].

=== How to propose a topic?

1. Start a discussion with your proposal in the link:https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev[developer mailing list]
2. Wait for initial feedback in the mailing list.
   If there is a strong consensus among community members and no formal approval needed, the mailing list thread might be enough.
