= Pipeline as Code with Jenkins

The default interaction model with Jenkins, historically, has been very web UI
driven, requiring users to manually create jobs, then manually fill in the
details through a web browser. This requires additional effort to create and
manage jobs to test and build multiple projects, it also keeps the
configuration of a job to build/test/deploy separate from the actual code being
built/tested/deployed. This prevents users from applying their existing CI/CD
best practices to the job configurations themselves.


== Pipeline

With the introduction of the {plugin}/workflow-aggregator{plugin}[Pipeline plugin],
users now can implement a project's entire build/test/deploy pipeline
in a `Jenkinsfile` and store that alongside their code, treating their
pipeline as another piece of code checked into source control.

The Pipeline plugin was inspired by the
link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Build+Flow+Plugin{plugin}[Build Flow
plugin] but aims to improve upon some concepts explored by Build Flow with
features like:

* the ability to suspend/resume of executing jobs.
* checking the pipeline definition into source control (`Jenkinsfile`)
* support for extending the domain specific language with additional,
  organization specific steps, via the
  "link:/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/{plugin}[Shared Libraries]" feature.

In an adjacent space is the
{plugin}/job-dsl{plugin}[Job DSL plugin]
which is worth mentioning as well.


== Getting Started

* The {plugin}/workflow-aggregator{plugin}[Pipeline plugin]
  has a fairly comprehensive
  link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-plugin/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md{plugin}[tutorial]
  checked into its source tree too.
