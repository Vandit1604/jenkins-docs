The SIG offers a venue for all kinds of documentation creation, improvement, and delivery.

The group focuses on documentation for Jenkins, including:

* xref:user-docs:ROOT:index.adoc[User documentation] - Using Jenkins
** xref:tutorials:index.adoc[Tutorials]
** xref:user-docs:ROOT:index.adoc[User Handbook]
** References like xref:user-docs:pipeline:syntax.adoc[Pipeline Syntax] and link:/doc/pipeline/steps/[Pipeline Steps]
** xref:ROOT:how-to-guides.adoc[How-to Guides]
* xref:dev-docs:ROOT:index.adoc[Developer documentation] - Extending Jenkins
** xref:plugin-tutorial:index.adoc[Tutorials]
** xref:dev-docs:reference:index.adoc[Developer Reference]
** xref:dev-docs:guides:index.adoc[How-To Guides]
* xref:solutions:ROOT:index.adoc[Solution documentation] - using Jenkins with specific technologies (e.g. Java, PHP, or Docker).
  Also, implementation solutions like xref:solutions:ROOT:pipeline.adoc[Pipeline]

Documentation SIG may cooperate with other groups.
For example, we cooperate with the xref:platform:index.adoc[Platform SIG] on platform topics.

[[ongoing-projects]]
== Projects

This section lists some of the projects working under the direction of this SIG.
See the link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ygRZnVtoIvuEKpwNeF_oVRVCV5NKcZD1_HMtWlUZguo/edit?usp=sharing[SIG meeting notes] for more information about ongoing projects.

=== Google Season of Docs

Google Season of Docs brings together open source communities and technical writers for the benefit of both.
The program raises awareness of open source, of documentation, and of technical writing.

See our xref:docs:gsod/index.adoc[Google Season of Docs status page] for documentation project ideas, contact information, and more.

=== Plugin documentation on GitHub

Currently the SIG is xref:dev-docs:publishing:wiki-page.adoc#migrating-from-wiki-to-github[migrating plugin documentation from Jenkins Wiki to GitHub].
Documentation in the plugin GitHub repository provides a good user experience for Jenkins users seeking documentation. 
At the same time, plugin maintainers now can follow the documentation-as-code approach and make documentation changes a part of the pull requests. 
It also gives an opportunity to review the documentation changes and to add documentation contributor recognition, 
especially if the story is combined with link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/.github/blob/master/.github/release-drafter.adoc[changelog automation]. 

As of November 2022 we have more than 900 plugins which already use GitHub as a documentation source,
but there are still hundreds of plugins to migrate.
We invite contributors to participate in the project and to help us with migrating the docs.
It is also a great opportunity to update and copy-edit the documentation.

Useful links:

* link:/blog/2019/10/21/plugin-docs-on-github/[Documentation migration guidelines blog post]

* xref:dev-docs:publishing:documentation.adoc#plugin-pages[Using GitHub as a source of plugin documentation]

=== Plugin site integration with GitHub

link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Plugin Site] currently uses GitHub to get plugin documentation (see above) and tags (using GitHub topics).
Release information is also pulled from GitHub releases.
There are still some areas for improvement, such as parsing of CHANGELOG.md files to get release information for plugins that don't use GitHub releases.
This project is tracked in the {jira}WEBSITE-637[] EPIC.

[[user-guide]]
=== User Guide Rework

Jenkins user topics are included in the current xref:user-docs:ROOT:index.adoc[Jenkins Handbook].
link:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nA8xVOkyKmZ8oTYSLdwjborT0w-BpBNNZT0nxR9deZ8/edit#gid=1087292709[Feedback requests] are frequently received to improve user documentation.
Common improvement themes include adding migration of the documentation from Wiki, pipeline examples with each of the pipeline steps, additional tutorials for new users, better search and navigation.

[[administrator-guide]]
=== Administrator Guide

Jenkins administration topics are included in the current xref:user-docs:ROOT:index.adoc[Jenkins Handbook].
Navigation can be improved for administrators by separating the administration topics into a separate volume.
This project will create a separate Jenkins Administrator Guide with content specific for administrators.
This project is tracked in the {jira}WEBSITE-738[] EPIC.

[[solution-pages]]
=== Solution Pages

Jenkins xref:solutions:ROOT:index.adoc[solution pages] highlight specific use cases for Jenkins users.
Those solutions include SCM provider solutions (xref:solutions:ROOT:github.adoc[GitHub], xref:solutions:ROOT:bitbucketserver.adoc[Bitbucket]),
programming language solutions (xref:solutions:ROOT:python.adoc[Python], xref:solutions:ROOT:ruby[Ruby], xref:solutions:ROOT:c.adoc[C/C++], xref:solutions:ROOT:java.adoc[Java], and xref:solutions:ROOT:php.adoc[PHP]),
and execution environment solutions (xref:solutions:ROOT:python.adoc[Pipeline], xref:solutions:ROOT:docker.adoc[Docker], xref:solutions:ROOT:embedded.adoc[Embedded], and xref:solutions:ROOT:android.adoc[Android]).
An excellent xref:solutions:ROOT:index.adoc[opening page] has been provided by link:https://github.com/zbynek[Zbynek Konecny].
Additional use cases and user stories are being collected by link:https://github.com/alyssat[Alyssa Tong].

The appearance and navigation of those solution pages needs improvement.
The existing pages should be revisited and improved so that users of specific solutions can find what they need on jenkins.io.
This project is tracked in the {jira}WEBSITE-742[] EPIC.
