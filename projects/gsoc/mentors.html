<li>
<p>Recruit additional mentors for projects (if possible)</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you do not have enough potential mentors for a project,
do spend a few hours looking for co-mentors (mailing list, chat room, social media, etc.) and contact them.
You should also setup introduction audio or video conference with them, and you should invite them to the office hours meeting.
It is good to discuss your mutual interests (why you are interested in the same projects, your respective backgrounds in open source, etc.)
and your respective availabilities during the program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mentors must make sure they get invited by org admins, and must make sure to respond to that invitation

<p>All mentors work with the GSoC Contributor during all phases on the program,
answering the GSoC Contributor questions, coaching, advising, motivating, unblocking, reviewing code and pull-requests, ensuring the process is followed,
ensuring communications are in public as this is an open source program, and report issues to the lead mentor, etc.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Officially, this phase is divided in two:</p>
</div>

<li>
<p>GSoC Contributors explore and discuss projects and project ideas</p>

<li>
<p>GSoC Contributors formally apply to GSoC with Google</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During this long phase, mentors are expected to actively interact and discuss with GSoC Contributors on projects they wish to mentor.
This means that you need to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>answer questions from GSoC Contributors and clarify the project&#8217;s detailed objectives with them</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>review the GSoC Contributor pull-request(s) if any (some GSoC Contributors send fixes for small issues during this phase to get familiar with the process)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>find out who else is interested in the same project as you (your co-mentors)</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can still submit new project ideas during this phase.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="ranking_and_slot_request_phase"><a class="anchor" href="#ranking_and_slot_request_phase"></a>Proposal ranking and slot request phase</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Expectation:</strong> about 5 hours total, plus continuous interaction with potential GSoC Contributors, until the community bonding starts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This phase is divided in two sub-phases:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="#slot_request_sub_phase">Initial proposal ranking and slot request sub-phase</a>: usually 2 to 3 weeks (not very long)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#final_selection_phase">Final proposal selection sub-phase</a>: usually 1 week (very short!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mentor teams are formalized during this phase, and mentors must be registered with the GSoC website.
For details on forming mentor teams, see <a href="#forming_mentor_teams">Mentors and mentor teams</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GSoC Contributor proposals are ranked for slot requests, and a final selection is made.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that <strong>we are NOT allowed to communicate any information regarding the selection to GSoC Contributors during this phase until Google makes the official GSoC Contributor Project Announcements.</strong>
We do not make this announcement, Google does.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="slot_request_sub_phase"><a class="anchor" href="#slot_request_sub_phase"></a>Initial proposal ranking and slot request sub-phase</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of this phase is to determine and request the minimum and the maximum number of projects we can take on as an organization.
This process is explained in the Mentor Guide in the
<a href="https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/selecting-students-and-mentors#slot-count">Slot Count</a> section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have three weeks to send our slot request to Google.
<strong>It is an intense and critical period for Org Admins and mentors</strong>,
as this determines who participates in the rest of the program!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During this phase, mentors and org admins need to rank the projects.
Fake and incomplete proposals are discarded.
Good proposals are ranked in order of chances of success.
Here we look for quality, completeness and compliance of the GSoC Contributor applications and our capacity to mentor.
We usually get more projects than we can mentor, so we must make a selection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regarding our capacity to mentor a project,
it is critical at this phase that <strong>mentors register their name in the Google GSoC system and
assign themselves to all the projects they would like to mentor</strong> (as if they had infinite time).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we rank projects, we make sure mentors only get the number of projects they want (usually one or two)
regardless of how many projects the mentor registers for.
We also ask mentors to rank the projects they&#8217;d like to mentor in order of their preference.
Org Admins make sure there is at least TWO mentors per project.
The Org Admins help organize mentor teams and projects are ranked in a manner that tries to maximize success and happiness for everyone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that we allow mentors to participate in more than one project only if the mentor agrees with it.
We do not recommend taking on more than two projects.
You can still contribute in the Jenkins project while you mentor in GSoC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This all sounds complicated, but long story short, this phase is when the match making process formally happens between mentors, GSoC Contributors and projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The max number should never exceed our total mentoring capacity.
The min number is the quantity of projects we feel confident we can mentor and succeed.
For example We can feel very confident about 5 projects,
and reasonably about 2 projects, and not enough confident about the rest.
Then our min and max would be 5 and 7.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then we send our slot request min and max numbers to Google.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="final_selection_phase"><a class="anchor" href="#final_selection_phase"></a>Final proposal selection sub-phase</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This phase is very short and starts immediately when Google sends us our final number of slots.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We may get only the minimum of slots.
Sometimes heart wrenching decisions need to be made.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Org Admins and Mentors need to make an extra effort to devote time to this phase because it is very short and this does not leave us much time to make critical decisions, and it just as important as the other phases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During this phase, mentors and Jenkins Org Admins hold a private meeting to make the final project selection
and the mentor teams are finalized and confirmed. Then we submit our final selection to the GSoC program.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We wait. We are NOT allowed to communicate any information regarding the selection to GSoC Contributors.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="community_bonding_phase"><a class="anchor" href="#community_bonding_phase"></a>Community Bonding</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Expectation:</strong> about 5 to 8 hours per week, until coding starts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the most critical phase when it comes to working with your GSoC Contributor.
Year after year, if this phase goes well, the rest of the program usually goes well, but if this phase does not go well, the project usually fails.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mentors are expected to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Send a welcome message to their GSoC Contributor within 24 hours after the projects are announced (<a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline">GSoC timeline</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organize your first meeting with the GSoC Contributor, within the first week.
Bring as many contributors as possible there, and make sure to celebrate and to discuss the next steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the pace, establish your regular meeting times together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agree on the main communication channels (chats or mailing lists).
GSoC org admins can help you to create communication channels if needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help the GSoC Contributor to do first contributions to the project if it has not happened before.
Newbie-friendly issues might be a good start.
Get them merged and released as soon as possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the GSoC Contributor has a detailed plan and a design document for the first coding phase before it starts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get the GSoC Contributor to create issues in Jira for the work items of the coming coding phase</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have written a guide for this phase, <a href="students.html#community-bonding" class="xref page">read it</a> and follow it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In rare cases, it is acceptable to re-work the project idea, even change it completely, as long as the GSoC Contributor and the mentors all agree.
Written documentation about this is essential, if it happens, let the Org Admins know.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let Jenkins Org Admins know as soon as possible if there is any need for knowledge transfer sessions.
We often organize special public presentations to go over plugin and core development flows and code that
GSoC Contributors and mentors alike benefit from attending.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="coding_periods"><a class="anchor" href="#coding_periods"></a>Coding Periods</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Expectation:</strong> about 5 to 8 hours per week until the end of the program.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>See also: <a href="students.html#coding-periods" class="xref page">student coding periods</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are mentoring now. Guide, coach, review pull-requests, unblock the GSoC Contributor,
ensure GSoC Contributors use Jira for task, bug and feature tracking,
meet your GSoC Contributor at least once or twice per week over a live one-on-one session
(video conferencing and screen sharing is infinitely useful here).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What if the GSoC Contributor is done early? GSoC Contributor and mentor must determine other work that can be done and let the Jenkins Org Admins know.</p>

<h3 id="eval_periods"><a class="anchor" href="#eval_periods"></a>Evaluation periods</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Expectation:</strong> same as during the coding periods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See also: <a href="students.html#evaluations" class="xref page">student evaluations</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mentors are expected to evaluate their GSoC Contributor, while they continue to mentor them.
Coding seldom completely stops during this period.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mentors are expected to:
* ensure that the GSoC Contributor creates a presentation and prepares a demo
* ensure their GSoC Contributor presents their project (presentation and demo) at a public meeting in the style of an on-line meetup.
<strong> We record these presentations and publish them on YouTube.
* evaluate their GSoC Contributor by comparing the GSoC Contributor project plan with the actual code produced.
</strong> There is usually great flexibility as we allow mentors and GSoC Contributors to agree on what the expectations are in terms of features and content.
* fill in the GSoC evaluation form and provide written feedback in that form to their GSoC Contributor and to the Google GSoC organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This period is a good time to review the Jira tickets and prepare the tickets for the next coding phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If too little code is produced for reasons that cannot be understood,
inform your GSoC Contributor of your concerns, and ask the GSoC Contributor why this is happening.
Often GSoC Contributors are blocked on a technical problem and do not communicate with their mentors.
As a rule of thumb, there should be code pushed to Github almost every day.
If not, let the Org Admins know as soon as possible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="after_the_program"><a class="anchor" href="#after_the_program"></a>After the program</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many GSoC Contributors ask their mentors how they can continue to contribute after the program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You could setup one-on-one on-line meeting with the GSoC Contributor on a monthly basis.
You can invite the GSoC Contributor to SIG or other community meetings.
Jenkins also has on-line meetups with various people presenting that the GSoC Contributor might be interested in joining.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually, you can invite the GSoC Contributor to look at the bugs and features that have been captured
in Jira during the coding phases for inspiration on what to do next.
You can also invite GSoC Contributors to apply next year as a GSoC Contributor or even as a mentor.
GSoC Contributors like to see their projects continue, and becoming a mentor is a great way to make that happen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Google organizes a mentor summit a few months after the program has ended.
Each year, the Jenkins Org Admins select 2 mentors who get to go to that summit
(travel costs and accommodations are paid for by Google).
Mentors agree that this is a fantastic event!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some mentors travel to the Jenkins World conference and get to meet GSoC Contributors and other mentors.
This is definitely a conference worth attending for mentors and GSoC Contributors alike.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GSoC program lasts several months.
We know people go on vacation and need to take time off from their regular day job.
We are flexible.
This is one of the reasons why we also assign at least two mentors per GSoC Contributor.
Make sure you timely communicate your availability to your GSoC Contributor, your co-mentors, and the org admins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you must withdraw from the program completely, let the Jenkins Org Admins know as soon as possible.
Life happens, but we need to know about unplanned changes so that we can ensure continuity of the ongoing GSoC projects.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We appreciate mentorship provided by any Jenkins contributor.
On the other hand, we want to avoid any conflicts with GSoC rules and spirit.
We also want to avoid conflicts of interest between all sides.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only an individual contributor may be a mentor according to GSoC rules.
One or more company representatives may act as individual contributors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All mentors and org admins are considered as Jenkins community representatives.
They must follow the <a href="/conduct">Code of Conduct</a></p>

<li>
<p>If a mentor works for a company, which use Jenkins in commercial products&#8230;&#8203;</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The mentorship work should be performed during spare time or during the OSS contribution time dedicated by the company.
In the latter case the mentor should ensure that there will be a consistent time dedicated over the entire GSoC mentorship period</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The project proposed by mentors should not overlap neither with direct responsibilities within the company nor with the company product roadmaps.</p>
