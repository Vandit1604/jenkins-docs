<h2 id="_who_we_are"><a class="anchor" href="#_who_we_are"></a>Who we are</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Jenkins project as a community revolves around Jenkins as a piece of software. We are a group of open-source developers and users who develop, use, promote Jenkins, software around Jenkins, and other related activities for our mutual benefit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project is a part of the <a href="https://cd.foundation/">Continuous Delivery Foundation</a> and
affiliated with the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a> legal entities which legally own the project assets and act as treasury.
Before 2021, these roles were held by
<a href="https://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in the Public Interest, Inc.</a> (SPI).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_our_philosophy"><a class="anchor" href="#_our_philosophy"></a>Our Philosophy</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_lower_barrier_of_entry"><a class="anchor" href="#_lower_barrier_of_entry"></a>Lower barrier of entry</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We strive for lower barrier of entry to the project. This is partly achieved by not requiring new contributors to “prove themselves” before they are admitted to the committership. Instead, we assume they are good until proven otherwise, and this principle applies to anybody without arbitrary discrimination. We recognize that every contribution is precious, and we recognize that every added process turn away some potential contributors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lower barrier of entry is partly achieved by structuring the project to core, plugins, modules, and other independent pieces, thereby reducing the need for collaboration and communication. We try to let everyone have their own turf where they can work efficiently without bogged down by discussions and compromises. We believe everyone has the right to express their idea in their own plugins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lower barrier of entry is also partly achieved by recognizing that people move on. Lots of code in the project is maintained by people other than the original author. We encourage new contributors to take over existing projects that aren’t actively maintained. We believe that “old” contributors deserve respect from “new” contributors, but the inaction on the part of the original contributors shall not block new contributors from making changes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_meritocracy"><a class="anchor" href="#_meritocracy"></a>Meritocracy</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our striving to lower barrier of entry doesn’t mean everyone has the equal voice. We value those who contribute more to the project, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy">Meritocracy</a>. Contribution shouldn’t be narrowly interpreted just to code changes, but rather it includes such activities as helping others in the community, doing PR, running infrastructure, and so on.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_transparency"><a class="anchor" href="#_transparency"></a>Transparency</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We believe in running the project transparently. This includes everything from decision-making to defects in the code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_compatibility_matters"><a class="anchor" href="#_compatibility_matters"></a>Compatibility matters</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We recognize that users expect their existing data, accumulated under past versions (including Hudson up to 1.395) to continue working under future versions of Jenkins. This includes jobs configurations, build records, and plugin binaries that they are using. The Jenkins project places high value on maintaining this compatibility, and will be very careful in removing functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To enable the above goal, we also recognize that plugin developers expect APIs and other code that they depend on to remain available in future versions of Jenkins. This is not to say we don’t ever remove anything, but we do it very carefully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because one plugin can depend on another, we expect the same principle from plugins that many other plugins depend on.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_automation"><a class="anchor" href="#_automation"></a>Automation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the goals of the Jenkins project is to enable more automation, and we apply the same principle in developing Jenkins. Accordingly, we develop and use a number of daemons, bots, and scripts to perform house-keeping activities and day-to-day operations, we use Jenkins ourselves to run many of those.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This not only frees our time to do more creative work, but it also helps reduce the barrier to entry by reducing the blockage of one developer by another. Plus it has the added benefit of eating our own dogfood.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_license"><a class="anchor" href="#_license"></a>License</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Jenkins project uses the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a> as the primary license of choice, for the code that we develop. Unless otherwise stated, all the code is under the MIT license.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins">core of Jenkins</a> is entirely under the MIT license, as is the majority of our <a href="https://github.com/jenkins-infra">infrastructure code</a> (that runs the project itself), as well as many plugins. We encourage hosted plugins to use the same MIT license, to simplify the story for users, but plugins are free to choose their own licenses, so long as it’s an <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/">OSI-approved</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-domain-equivalent_license">public-domain-equivalent</a> license or dedicated to the public domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not to be confused with proprietary plugins --- we recognize and encourage plugins that people write on their own for their internal use, without necessarily making the source code available. But no such plugins will be hosted by the Jenkins project.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="cla"><a class="anchor" href="#cla"></a>Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To further clarify the intellectual property rights around the project, we require that core committers sign a contributor agreement.
The Jenkins project uses the EasyCLA service provided by the Linux Foundation.
Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/infra-cla/blob/master/README.md">infra-cla README</a> for contributor license agreement submission instructions.
More details are available from the Linux Foundation for <a href="https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/v2-current/contributors/individual-contributor">individual contributors</a> and <a href="https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/v2-current/contributors/corporate-contributor">corporate contributors</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>EasyCLA is self service and requires no manual intervention by the board or any other Jenkins project member.
It is a one-time process, valid for all <a href="conduct.html#community-spaces" class="xref page">Jenkins community spaces</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CLAs come in two flavors. Every core contributor needs to sign an Individual CLA (ICLA), and in cases where you as an individual do not own the work you are contributing (such as when your company assigns you to work on Jenkins and therefore your company owns the hard work you produced), the corporation also needs to sign a Corporate CLA (CCLA). See <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">the discussion in Apache for more details</a>. The CLA forms can be obtained by following the documentation in the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/infra-cla">infra-cla</a> repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To balance the additional overhead with the lower barrier to entry, this policy only applies to the core, although we welcome anyone who&#8217;s willing to submit a CLA for their work on plugins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Details to submit CLAs are documented in <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/infra-cla/blob/master/README.md">infra-cla README</a>.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_3rd_party_library_licenses_in_the_core"><a class="anchor" href="#_3rd_party_library_licenses_in_the_core"></a>3rd party library licenses in the core</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Jenkins project depends heavily on 3rd party libraries. We believe it&#8217;s better to reuse what we can than to reinvent, so that our precious resources can be spent elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jenkins as a whole needs to be an open-source project, so we&#8217;ve been restricting ourselves to only use 3rd party libraries that are under <a href="https://www.opensource.org/">OSI-approved</a> (such as Apache Software License, BSD license, MIT license, Eclipse Public License, and Lesser GNU Public License) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-domain-equivalent_license">public-domain-equivalent</a> licenses or dedicated to the public domain. In addition, to keep the core reusable for the widest possible use cases, we refuse so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft licenses</a> that restrict the overall license to a specific license (such as GNU Public License.) To that end, we designated the following licenses as approved licenses that we can depend on. Additional licenses are subject to the approval by the board:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<li>
<p><a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/">Apache Software License</a></p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>In core, the build process ensure that all the licenses of the dependency libraries are accounted for. In other words, we require that dependency POMs declare their own licenses in the Maven way, or use <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/licenseCompleter.groovy">the license completion script</a> to supply one where the POM is missing that information. The completion script is also used in case the library is dual-licensed to pick a specific license.

<a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins">The official core repository</a> is hosted on GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Jenkins core is maintained by a team of long time committers who review and integrate changes submitted through <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pulls">GitHub pull requests</a>.
They also coordinate the Jenkins releases.
See the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/docs/MAINTAINERS.adoc">Jenkins Core maintainer guidelines</a> for more information about roles, their responsibilities and maintenance processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<h3 id="_release_lines"><a class="anchor" href="#_release_lines"></a>Release lines</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Jenkins project provides two release lines for the Jenkins core.

</div>
<div class="dlist">

<dt class="hdlist1">LTS Releases</dt>
<dd>
<p>Every three months or so we pick a prior release as the new long-term support (LTS) release and then create the ‘stable’ branch, from that release point.

<h3 id="_modules"><a class="anchor" href="#_modules"></a>Modules</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modules are libraries that are built separately from the core (much like plugins are), but are bundled into the WAR file as a JAR file in <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> and therefore it behaves as if it&#8217;s a part of the core from the users' point of view.
Modules can be thought of as something in between a library and a plugin.
It has its own POM, a set of source code, and is built separately, like a library, but it gets the same compile-time processing as plugins do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This assists splitting a big hair ball (that is the core) into more manageable smaller pieces, and allow OEMs to add/remove functionalities separately.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_plugins"><a class="anchor" href="#_plugins"></a>Plugins</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Plugins are developed autonomously by the people working on the plugin.
Each gets its own repository, its own Jenkins-on-Jenkins job, its own issue tracker component, and maintains its own release schedule.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some plugins are actively maintained by a small number of people and they may have their own local culture, such as different coding convention, additional commit policies. We do this so that people can feel ownership and attachment to their effort, and so that they won’t feel like they have to follow externally decided rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since much of such local culture is implicit, it&#8217;s often difficult to tell from outside the operating culture of a given plugin. The safe rule of thumb is to contact existing developers upfront before doing any commit (but if there&#8217;s no timely response in a week so, you should feel free to commit.) Less actively maintained plugins tend not to have such local culture, so in those cases, if you feel lucky you can commit changes ahead and send a heads-up simultaneously, (and accept the possibility that the changes get reverted.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maintainer information is listed on <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/" class="bare">https://plugins.jenkins.io/</a> and is defined in the <a href="https://github.com/jenkins-infra/repository-permissions-updater">repository permissions updater</a>.
If you have trouble figuring out who to contact, the good fallback option is the developers' mailing list.</p>

<h3 id="_plugin_site"><a class="anchor" href="#_plugin_site"></a>Plugin Site</h3>

These pages provide documentation and information about the plugin: installation statistics, changelogs, known issues, etc.
Documentation is retrieved from the GitHub repository of the plugin or from an archived copy of the decommissioned Jenkins wiki.

It&#8217;s generally more practical and appreciated if you submit changes that don&#8217;t change the code format too much as it eases the coding review job. Try submitting formatting changes and functional changes in separate commits.</p>

<h3 id="_copying_code_from_elsewhere"><a class="anchor" href="#_copying_code_from_elsewhere"></a>Copying code from elsewhere</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you have a license to do so, and when that license is compatible with the MIT license, you can copy the code from elsewhere into Jenkins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most typical case of this is that the original code is licensed under a certain subset of the open-source licenses, such as ASL, BSD, and MIT license. Copyleft licenses, even though they are open-sourced, cannot be copied, such as EPL and GPL.
In particular, this means we can copy Oracle Hudson&#8217;s source code under the MIT license, but not Eclipse Hudson&#8217;s source code under EPL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code to be copied must be clearly marked with the license it is under, and when copying, you need to maintain the copyright/license attribution in the header. Please also indicate the origin of the copy as a part of the commit message.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_locally_patching_dependencies"><a class="anchor" href="#_locally_patching_dependencies"></a>Locally patching dependencies</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, it is necessary to make bug fixes and changes in the libraries that we use. Where the library is significant to Jenkins and the impact is considerable to our users, we choose to maintain local patch sets to upstream libraries, just like Linux distributions maintain such patches for its packages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We normally intend such local patches to be integrated into upstream, so we file tickets upstream and provide our diff. When this works, this allows us to go back to the pristine upstream release at some point in the future. Those patch sets are maintained in our git repositories as a parallel branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some cases, the supposed "temporary" patch sets became more permanent for various reasons beyond our control, such as the ceased development in the upstream, but that&#8217;s only because that&#8217;s how it turned out, not because we intended it at the outset. With the distributed version control system, maintaining parallel patch release for Jenkins isn&#8217;t as hard as it used to be.</p>

<p>It is often the case that the original developer moves onto other things once the plugin becomes good enough for them (or if the original author changes the job and no longer has incentive to work on the technology.)

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As discussed above, Jenkins project uses pull requests as one of the main workflow to get the changes in. When you prepare your pull request, consider the following checklist as the best practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>See <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/">the github online help</a> for how to create a pull request</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We encourage you to file a ticket in <a href="https://issues.jenkins.io/">the issue tracker</a> to describe the bug that you are fixing or the feature you are implementing. This creates a permanent record on our system that allows future developers to understand how the code came into the current shape. This is not a requirement (especially for small changes), but we appreciate if you do that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refer to the ticket in your commit message by using the notation <code>[JENKINS-1234]</code> where <em>JENKINS-1234</em> is the ticket ID. This allows our scripts to understand the history and generate changelogs without human help. If you use the notation <code>[FIX JENKINS-1234]</code>, our bot will close the ticket automatically when the change is merged into the repository, and when the change is tested in our CI server. These notations create useful cross-references across systems, and are therefore highly recommended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We encourage you to have a test case for the code you added to avoid future regressions. See <a href="../dev-docs/testing/index.html" class="xref page">Testing</a> for more details about how to write tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to describe your changes so that other people understand what you did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you didn’t modify portions that aren’t related to your changes (most often caused by IDE auto-fixing import statements and other code formats.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We do try to be attentive to inbound pull requests, unfortunately we may fail to review some of them in a timely fashion.
