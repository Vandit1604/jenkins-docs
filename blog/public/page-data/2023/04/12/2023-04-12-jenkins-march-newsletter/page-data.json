class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Over the course of March, the Jenkins infrastructure team has worked to provide several enhancements and updates including:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Huge effort on bandwidth reduction for dependencies from JFrog, by switching almost all workloads to the new artifact caching proxy, with a focus on developer UX to allow disabling it when unreliable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All of the controller Azure credentials are managed as code, opening the door for safer identity management.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved safety and reliability for the releases of both weekly and Jenkins Core, by migrating this process into a new private Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maven 3.9.0 and 3.9.1 were rolled-out to developers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Ubuntu 22.04 upgrade campaign has been planned and started.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new GPG key rolled-out for signing Jenkins repositories and Core artifacts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Usual maintenance efforts to keep the infrastructure running, including weekly dependency upgrades, support for the 2 security advisories, and migrating pipelines from GitHub actions to our own Jenkins private instances.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div id=\"modern-ui\" class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img

Jenkins weekly releases.\nThe modal dialog does not move the user away from the current page.\nExpect to see more modal dialogs in Jenkins in the future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>More Jenkins messages have been translated into Turkish thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mustafau\">Mustafa Ulu</a>.\nThey have been released in Jenkins weekly releases in March.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Support for <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/7299\">user experimental flags</a> (\"feature flags\") has been added to Jenkins core.\nDevelopers can deliver new features and allow users to enable or disable those features for their own account.\nThanks to Wadeck Follonier for the implementation and thanks to all those who reviewed and helped with the pull request.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"documentation\" class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img

experiences using Jenkins in intriguing ways, as well as starting a new series of posts regarding Android and Jenkins.\nWe also crossed into triple digits (101) for the number of pull requests merged this month for jenkins.io alone.\nAlong with recent UI updates, the Jenkins documentation is being updated to reflect the simplified Manage Jenkins settings names.\nThanks to all of the continuing and new contributors, all of your work helps support both the Jenkins project and the Open-Source community.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"platform\" class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img
