Jenkins, which has no limitations as far as I know.\nWe&#8217;re talking about building <em>something</em> with Jenkins, using an Android device as a Jenkins node, or potentially as a Jenkins controller.\nDoes this sounds appealing or strange enough to you?\nContinue reading to learn more about the relationship between Android and Jenkins!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_jenkins_and_aarch64\">Jenkins and <code>aarch64</code></h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I joined the Jenkins project in April 2022.\nAt that time, we could already find <code>aarch64 docker</code> images, for the agents or the controller, and regular installers for <code>aarch64</code> Linux.\nThe <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/layers/jenkins/jenkins/2.305-jdk11/images/sha256-700c20a5cd0eb3c69a825baf8197166bb078361c3351aab6806a386573dbc829?context=explore\">oldest image</a> for a controller I found was from August 2021, and the <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/layers/jenkins/jenkins/2.305-jdk11/images/sha256-700c20a5cd0eb3c69a825baf8197166bb078361c3351aab6806a386573dbc829?context=explore\">oldest image</a> for an agent was from February 2022.\nThis is nothing new, as Jenkins works on <code>aarch64</code> Linux and has been running on that CPU architecture for years.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy when using Linux on an <code>x86_64</code> machine, but it can be more difficult on an <code>aarch64</code> machine.\nThis is because the tools needed to build Android applications were not available until late 2021, with the release of Android Build Tools <code>31.0.0</code>.\nOf course, you can use <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861\">Rosetta</a> to build your applications, and even combine it with <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/running-x86-64-containers-mac-silicon-m1/\">Docker</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In my experience with Jenkins and <code>aarch64</code>, I have several <code>aarch64</code> Jenkins agents and controllers.\nSome of them are using <code>docker</code> and some of them are installed directly on the Linux machine thanks to the <a href=\"/doc/book/installing/linux/#debianubuntu\">standard instructions</a>.\nThankfully, there has been nothing outstanding to worry about, as Jenkins works fine for me with <code>aarch64</code>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_android_and_aarch64\">Android and <code>aarch64</code></h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Until recently, it was difficult to build Android applications on an <code>aarch64</code> machine.\nThe main reason was that the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/build-tools\">Android build tools</a> were not compatible with <code>aarch64</code> machines.\nBefore version <code>31.0.0</code>, there was a bug in the Android Build Tools that caused the <code>aapt2</code> tool to crash when building resources on <code>aarch64</code> machines.\nThis issue was resolved in version <code>31.0.0</code>, which added native support for <code>aarch64</code> and fixed the <code>aapt2</code> crash on these machines.\nThanks to this, Android Build Tools are now natively compatible with <code>aarch64</code>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Isn&#8217;t that fantastic?\nThis meant there was no need to use Rosetta to build Android apps on <code>aarch64</code> anymore.\nUntil I started writing this post, I was actually using build-tools <code>30.x</code>.\nI didn&#8217;t need to build Android apps on <code>aarch64</code> machines, so upgrading was unnecessary.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>However, a friend of mine works on an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1\">M1 Mac</a>, which happens to be an <code>aarch64</code> machine, and wanted to build Android apps on his Mac.\nHe was working with Docker, which translates <code>x86-64</code> to <code>aarch64</code>, as long as you specify that you&#8217;re using an <code>x86-64</code> image to begin with.\nI know it&#8217;s strange that <code>x86-64</code> is called <code><a href=\"https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/53416\">amd64</a></code> in Docker, but that&#8217;s not the point.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-yaml\" data-lang=\"yaml\">[...]\nandroid-agent:\n

from now on.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the introduction, I stated that I wanted to build something with Jenkins on an Android device, and not the other way around.\nThe goal is to run parts of Jenkins (first an agent, then a controller, then a whole Jenkins instance thanks to Docker) on an Android device.\nSo why am I telling you about building Android apps on <code>aarch64</code> machines with Jenkins?\nBecause it would be kind of ironic, and tons of fun, to build an Android app with Jenkins on an Android device!\nThat would even allow me to introduce you to the <em>Jenkinsception</em> concept.\nMore on that in a future post.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_get_sshd_working_on_an_android_device\">Get <code>sshd</code> working on an Android device</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>What does <code>sshd</code> have to do with installing Jenkins?\nWell, we have a few different ways to start and connect a Jenkins agent to a Jenkins controller, but the easiest one for me is to use an ssh agent.\nThe first step is to get <code>sshd</code> working on an Android device.\nThere are various ways to access an Android device through SSH.\nHere are some of them:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb\">ADB</a>: You can use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to connect to your Android device over SSH.\nThis requires you to enable USB debugging on your device and have ADB installed on your computer.\nThe following guide may not work any longer, but it&#8217;s a good starting point: <a href=\"https://dtbaker.net/blog/howto-enable-ssh-on-android-and-network-adb/\">How to enable ssh on Android</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.galexander.sshd\">SimpleSSHD</a>: SimpleSSHD is a lightweight and easy-to-use SSH server app for Android.\nIt supports key-based authentication, and you can configure it to run at startup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://termux.dev/en/\">Termux</a>: Termux is a terminal emulator and Linux environment app that allows you to start an SSH server on your Android device.\nYou can then use any SSH client to connect to your device over SSH.\nUnfortunately, updates for Termux are not available on the Google Play Store anymore, but you can still find it on <a href=\"https://github.com/termux/termux-app#github\">GitHub</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/termux/termux-app#f-droid\">F-Droid</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>It is important to note that SSH access to your device can pose security risks, so it is recommended to use caution and <strong>only</strong> enable SSH access when necessary.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Termux is my go-to choice when it comes to using some kind of Linux on Android.\nThere are packages available that will allow you to install new software, and package updates, like a \"real\" Linux distribution.\nI almost feel at home when using it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>While reading the <a href=\"https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Remote_Access\">Termux documentation</a>, I discovered that Termux has an SSH server (<a href=\"https://www.openssh.com/\">OpenSSH</a>) built-in.\nIt&#8217;s not enabled by default, but it&#8217;s easy enough to configure.\nThe following instructions are available on the <a href=\"https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Remote_Access#OpenSSH\">Termux wiki</a>, and I&#8217;ve added some details to make it easier to follow.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_starting_and_stopping_the_openssh_server\">Starting and stopping the OpenSSH server</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Since Termux does not use an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd\">initialization system</a>, services are started manually from the command line.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To start the OpenSSH server, you need to execute this command: <code>sshd</code>.\nIf you need to stop <code>sshd</code>, just kill its process: <code>pkill sshd</code>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>SSH daemon logs to the Android system log, and you can view them by running <code>logcat -s 'sshd:*'</code>.\nThis is possible from either Termux or ADB.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_setting_up_password_authentication\">Setting up password authentication</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Password authentication is enabled by default, making it easier to get started.\nBefore proceeding, make sure that you understand that password authentication is less secure than a pubkey-based one.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Ensure that everything is up-to-date and the <code>openssh</code> package is installed:<br></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\"> pkg upgradepkg install openssh</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Please note that <code>$PREFIX</code> is a variable that points to the Termux installation directory.\nIt is usually <code>/data/data/com.termux/files</code>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Password authentication is enabled by default in the configuration file.\nYou can review the file at <code>$PREFIX/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, and it should contain this data:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre> PrintMotd yes\n PasswordAuthentication yes\n Subsystem sftp /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/libexec/sftp-server</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If your file does not look like this, you will have to edit the file.\nNote that <code>vi</code> is not installed by default, but <code>nano</code> is.\nYou can use <code>nano</code> to edit the file.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Set a new password by executing the command <code>passwd</code>.\nWhile the program allows a minimal password length of one character, the recommended password length is more than eight to ten characters.\nPasswords are not printed on the console.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre> passwd New password:\n Retype new password:\n New password was successfully set.</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_setting_up_public_key_authentication\">Setting up public key authentication</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Public key authentication is the recommended way for logging in using SSH.\nYou need to have a public/private key pair to use this type of authentication.\nFor a successful login, the public key must exist in the authorized keys list on the remote machine, while the private key should be kept safe on your local host.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the following example, it is assumed that you want to establish public key authentication between your PC (host) and your future Jenkins agent, which happens to be an Android device running Termux (remote).\nIt is also assumed that you&#8217;re running a Linux distribution on your PC, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux#WSL_2\">WSL2</a>, or even <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin\">Cygwin</a>.\nIt would be better if both machines were using the same network, for example both are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.\nIt is also assumed that you know your Android device&#8217;s IP address.\nIf you have access to your router webpage, you should be able to see which IP has been assigned to your Android device.\nIf you don&#8217;t have access to the router webpage, you can find your IP address on an Android device by following these steps:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Open the Settings app on your Android device.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scroll down and tap on \"About phone\" or \"About device\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Look for the \"Status\" or \"Network\" section and tap it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Find the \"IP address\" or \"Wi-Fi IP address\" option, which will display your device&#8217;s IP address.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Alternatively, you can also find your IP address within Termux by typing the following command: <code>ip addr show</code>.\nBe aware that if the package is not installed yet, you will need to issue <code>pkg install iproute2</code> first.\nLook for the <code>inet</code> line next to the <code>wlan0</code> line that has your IP address given by your Wi-Fi router.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you do not have ssh keys, you can generate them.\nIn this example, we will generate an <code>RSA</code> key.\nOn the PC, execute the command: <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f id_rsa</code>, replacing <code>id_rsa</code> with the name of your key.\nFor me it would be <code>ssh_key_for_jenkins_agent_2023-03-10</code>.\nThe command shown above generates a private RSA key with a 2048-bit key length and saves it to the file <code>id_rsa</code>.\nIn the same directory, you can find a file named <code>id_rsa.pub</code>, and this is a public key.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For me, the command was:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\"> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ssh_key_for_jenkins_agent_2023-03-10\n Generating public/private rsa key

generated in the current directory, not in <code>$HOME/.ssh</code>.\nI tend to move the generated key in that <code>$HOME/.ssh</code> directory (<code>mv ssh_key_for_jenkins_agent_2023-03-10* ~/.ssh</code> for me).\nI then change the directory to <code>$HOME/.ssh</code> (<code>cd ~/.ssh</code>) and change the permissions of the key (<code>chmod 600 ssh_key_for_jenkins_agent_2023-03-10</code>).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonitionblock note\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"icon\">\n<div class=\"title\">Note</div>\n</td>\n<td class=\"content\">\n2048 bit is the minimal key length that is considered safe.\nYou can use higher values, but do not use a higher than 4096, as the remote server may not support that big of a key.\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Copy the key to the remote machine (your Jenkins agent wannabe running Termux).\nPassword authentication must be enabled to install a public key on the remote machine.\nNow execute: <code>ssh-copy-id -p 8022 -i id_rsa IP_ADDRESS</code>, making sure to replace <code>id_rsa</code> with the name of your key and <code>IP_ADDRESS</code> with the IP address of your Android machine.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Alternatively, you can manually copy the content inside <code>id_rsa.pub</code> (public key), which is already on the PC, and looks like <code>ssh-rsa &lt;A LOT OF RANDOM STRINGS&gt; user@host</code>.\nAfter copying, paste this content to the Termux file <code>$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> (remote machine).\nBefore copying and pasting, you must connect through <code>ssh user@IP_ADDRESS -p 8022</code>, replacing <code>IP_ADDRESS</code> with the IP address of your Android machine.\nDoing so enables you to copy the content of the public key, using any text editor available on PC, and paste it inside an ssh session handled by Termux.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>What looks strange to me is that <code>user</code> could be just about anything.\nI tried to log in without supplying a user, which means I was using my PC username, and it worked!\nI tried to log in with a different username and this also worked.\nWhen issuing the <code>whoami</code> command inside Termux, it shows the username of the Termux user, which is <code>u0_a504</code> in my case.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If everything went fine, you will see a message like this one:<br></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\"> Number of key(s) added: 1</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If your system has

newly generated key to the agent</a>.\nAfter adding the key, try logging into the machine with: <code>ssh -p '8022' 'IP_ADDRESS'</code>\nBe sure to replace <code>IP_ADDRESS</code> with the IP address of your Android machine and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.\nIf you don&#8217;t have an agent running, you will have to use a slightly different command: <code>ssh -i id_rsa -p '8022' 'IP_ADDRESS'</code>\nHere, you need to replace <code>id_rsa</code> with the name of your key and <code>IP_ADDRESS</code> with the IP address of your Android machine.\nThat would display for me as:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\"> ssh -i

disabled.\nUsing <code>nano</code>, edit the file <code>$PREFIX/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, and replace the line beginning <code>PasswordAuthentication</code> with <code>PasswordAuthentication no</code>.\nBack in the Termux app, execute the command <code>pkill sshd &amp;&amp; sshd</code> to restart the <code>sshd</code> server with the updated configuration file.\nOf course, if you were to do that from your PC, you would be disconnected and the ssh server would not be restarted.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Now you can log in to the remote machine without a password.\nJust execute the command <code>ssh -p '8022' 'IP_ADDRESS'</code>\nFor this command, replace <code>IP_ADDRESS</code> with the IP address of your Android machine, or with the more complex command <code>-i</code>, if your machine does not use an ssh agent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_installing_java_on_termux\">Installing Java on Termux</h2>\n<div
