Duportal]</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Following FOSDEM, where most of the infrastructure team was present physically, February was a busy month for the Jenkins Infrastructure team:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In an effort to reduce bandwidth with JFrog (repo.jenkins-ci.org), Jenkins continuous integration jobs are now using significantly less internet bandwidth thanks to the artifact caching proxy implemented by the team.\nThe artifact caching proxy is implemented on our three cloud providers, so that artifacts can be downloaded from a local cache rather than accessing the artifact repository.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jenkins LTS <code>2.375.3</code> is now used on all of our controllers, less than 3 days after its release.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We have removed all Jenkins deprecated plugins on all of our controllers such as jquery, momentjs, and ace-editor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We upgraded all six of our Kubernetes clusters from the <code>1.23</code> to <code>1.24</code> baseline in the three cloud providers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All of the private and internal web services are now using TLS with certificates provided by Let&#8217;s Encrypt, along with Azure DNS challenge.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We contributed to Docker documentation after catching issues with the Docker CE <code>23.x</code> fresh release and Docker BuildX on Ubuntu.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div id=\"documentation\" class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img

are considering CentOS 7 and its eventual end of life.\nThere is a proposal to deprecate the Centos <code>7</code> Jenkins controller Docker images.\nWhen we decide to deprecate these images, we&#8217;ll publish an announcement and a <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep\">JEP</a>.\nBefore it is fully deprecated, we&#8217;ll also release a merged version of the <code>centos</code> and
