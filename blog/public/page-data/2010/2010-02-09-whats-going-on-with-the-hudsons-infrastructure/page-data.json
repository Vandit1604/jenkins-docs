Downloading Hudson and/or plugins is now easier and more reliable.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We&#8217;ve moved issue tracking from java.net&#8217;s system to our own JIRA instance, at [issues.hudson-ci.org](<a href=\"https://issues.hudson-ci.org\" class=\"bare\">https://issues.hudson-ci.org</a>). As with moving downloads off java.net, we&#8217;ve made reporting and browsing Hudson&#8217;s issues much faster, easier and more reliable, while still using the same authentication on the back-end as our Subversion and Maven repositories. We&#8217;re still working out some kinks in the system but since we&#8217;re running our own issue tracker now, rather than using one we didn&#8217;t have control over, we&#8217;ve got the flexibility we need to adapt our tools to best serve the developer and user communities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Speaking of tools we now run ourselves, we&#8217;ve put up our own FishEye instance at [fisheye.hudson-ci.org](<a href=\"https://fisheye.hudson-ci.org\" class=\"bare\">https://fisheye.hudson-ci.org</a>) - until that was in place, we&#8217;d been relying on Atlassian&#8217;s public FishEye instance, which has many other open source projects' repositories available. Getting our own server up means we don&#8217;t have to bug the generous folks over at Atlassian every time the java.net SVN server confuses FishEye into failing to update. It also opens the door for us to use <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/crucible/\">Crucible</a> for code review in the future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hudson&#8217;s moved onto Twitter more and more over the last 6-9 months - we&#8217;ve got the always fabulous <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hudsonci\">@hudsonci</a>, tweeting new releases, Hudson-related tweets, and more, as well as the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hudsonci\">#hudsonci</a> hashtag.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This may not strictly be infrastructure but it&#8217;s worth mentioning that we&#8217;ve now got native packages and distribution for Hudson for <a href=\"https://hudson-ci.org/debian/\">Ubuntu/Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://hudson-ci.org/redhat/\">Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS</a>, <a href=\"https://hudson-ci.org/opensuse/\">openSUSE</a>, <a href=\"https://pkg.hudson-ci.org/\">OpenSolaris/Nevada</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.freshports.org/www/hudson/\">FreeBSD</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This is all in addition to key parts of our infrastructure that haven&#8217;t changed: our <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Home\">official wiki</a>, our <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Mailing+List\">user and developer mailing lists</a>, our <a href=\"https://hudson.dev.java.net/svn/hudson/trunk/hudson/\">Subversion repository</a> (and a <a href=\"https://github.com/kohsuke/hudson/\">Git mirror</a> on GitHub) and our <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/IRC+Channel\">IRC channel over on Freenode</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Oh, and I hear there&#8217;s a blog now too.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note: *Andrew Bayer (<code>abayer</code>) has been a contributor to Hudson since early 2009, contributing to the ClearCase plugin, Hudson&#8217;s core and a small number of other plugins.
