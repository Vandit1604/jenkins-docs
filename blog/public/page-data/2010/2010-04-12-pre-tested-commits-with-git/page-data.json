One of the positive changes that came out shortly after the meet up was the support for \"Concurrent Builds\", allowing a job to be executed concurrently on different agents, a precursor to pre-tested commit support. Fervor for the pre-tested commit feature lowered as time went on, the feature being too dependent on the SCM itself was generally accepted as the reasoning behind the feature languishing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Chances are the feature is in fact too large for Hudson to support alone. It requires Hudson, the SCM and likely a third tool to work in concert together to perform such a feat.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>With Git, and the phenomenal code review tool <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/\">Gerrit</a>, and the <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Plugin\">Gerrit plugin</a> by intrepid plugin developer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jyrkiputtonen\">Jyrki Puttonen</a>, pre-tested commits with Hudson, Git and Gerrit <em>are</em> possible.\nFor Git users more familiar with the distributed Git workflows, working with Gerrit should seem familiar. Gerrit has <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/\">JGit</a>, a Java implementation of Git embedded within it, along with an <code>sshd</code> stack, meaning Gerrit can masquerade as a \"regular\" Git remote repository. Developers can push and pull to the repository just as they can with any other Git repository (provided they have permissions of course). I won&#8217;t delve too much into using Gerrit specifically here, but the pre-tested workflow with Gerrit and Hudson would look something like this:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Dev creates a topic branch to work on a change</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Code is written (and hopefully tested) and committed locally</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dev pushes commit(s) to Gerrit</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hudson job (set to Poll SCM) picks up the patch, runs the job and marks it as \"+1 Verified\" or \"-1 Fails\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the job fails or is unstable, the change should be reworked or corrected (typically with <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html\">git-rebase(1)</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If Hudson says the change is good to go, it can be cherry-picked or pulled directly from Gerrit.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For example:<center>image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/gerrit_patch.png</center></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To learn more about Gerrit, check out the <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/\">project page on Google Code</a>; information on the Gerrit plugin can be <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Plugin\">found on the wiki</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>","document":{"title":"Pre-tested commits with Git","main":"Pre-tested commits with Git"},"author":{"fullName":null},"pageAttributes":{"author":"rtyler","tags":"infrastructure , feedback ,jobs ,tutorial","opengraph":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2420ee79-eb9b-55e6-8d87-f2d9e0e2664d"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
