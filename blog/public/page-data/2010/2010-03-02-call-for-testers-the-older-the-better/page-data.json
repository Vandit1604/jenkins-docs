One of Alan&#8217;s branches <code>old-data-monitor</code> was merged into trunk with <code>r28147</code> bringing with it some changes to help migrate older plugin datasets to newer formats.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>When I reached out to Alan earlier today on IRC (<code>#hudson</code> on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode\">Freenode</a>) about the subject he agreed that polling the community for beta testers would be a good idea; <strong>this is where <em>you</em> come in</strong>. Per Alan&#8217;s message to the <code>dev@</code> mailing list:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Visit your \"Manage Hudson\" screen to see if the notice about old/unreadable data appears. I&#8217;ll be curious to see which of the old deprecated data structures are actually out there in people&#8217;s XML files.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Instead of waiting for the release candidate to be packaged Wednesday evening, I&#8217;ve gone ahead and published the artifact from <a href=\"https://hudson.glassfish.org/view/Hudson/job/hudson-trunk/4544\">build #4544</a> which can be downloaded here: <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hudson_build4544.war\">hudson.war</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you have an <strong>old</strong> Hudson installation with, testing this build would be incredibly useful. Alan went on to say:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If people find issues with OldDataMonitor, they should file them at <a href=\"https://issues.hudson-ci.org\">issues.hudson-ci.org</a> in \"core\" component and assign them to \"mindless\".</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This change does not mutate any data (or at least it shouldn&#8217;t) so it should be safe, be on the look out for exceptions in Hudson&#8217;s log on startup.</p>\n</div>","document":{"title":"\"Call for Testers: The older the better\"","main":"\"Call for Testers"},"author":{"fullName":null},"pageAttributes":{"author":"rtyler","tags":"development , core ,jenkinsci","opengraph":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1ccc41f4-b5c6-5af2-8880-4104ba2eef85"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
