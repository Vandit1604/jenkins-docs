If hacking Hudson&#8217;s core isn&#8217;t your cup of tea, you can always start with the <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugin+tutorial\">plugin tutorial</a> and try your hand at writing another awesome Hudson plugin. If you find yourself struggling to find out what methods do what while you&#8217;re hacking, you can always visit the regularly updated, <a href=\"https://hudson.dev.java.net/nonav/javadoc/\">online Javadocs for Hudson</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Communicate</strong>\nThe two primary mediums for communicating with the Hudson community are through the <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Mailing%20List\">mailing lists</a> and the <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/IRC+Channel\">IRC channel</a>.
