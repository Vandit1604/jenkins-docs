This being our second \"spotlight\" on a particular company, the format can still be considered <em>beta</em>; if you have any additional questions for Rasheed, feel free to ask them in the comments and I&#8217;ll try to get Rasheed to answer.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Similar to the spotlight on ITA Software from last week, VisFleet builds business software helping their customers operate their businesses more effectively through web applications in tandem with mobile applications. While I could endlessly discuss the power and flexibility of Hudson, particularly for building web software, I&#8217;ll let Rasheed do the majority of the talking, so let&#8217;s get to it.\nintroducing <a id=\"aptureLink_qn9wDVslnL\" href=\"https://twitter.com/visfleet\">VisFleet</a>, would you mind explaining a bit more of what you guys do and some of the challenges it presents?</td></tr></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Rasheed</strong></td><td>It&#8217;s a pleasure. VisFleet has changed it&#8217;s direction somewhat, moving from\nservices into product development. As we move into product, we want to be\nresponsive to our customers. Agile development is becoming core to how we\noperate, and as such, continuous builds and integration became a major\nfactor. We now plan to offer two products for work planning and and vehicle\ntracking. We want to present these systems with a SaaS model. The world of\nonline, pay as you go software, has a culture of frequent improvements and\nresponsiveness to user feedback. If we want to do well in this space, it&#8217;s\nimportant that we can code, test, release and feed back in\ntight iterations.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><br></br></td></tr></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><tr><td align=\"center\"><strong>Hudson</strong></td><td>How long has VisFleet been using Hudson?</td></tr></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Rasheed</strong></td><td>About 14 months now.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><br></br></td></tr></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><tr><td align=\"center\"><strong>Hudson</strong></td><td>Did you guys work with continuous integration prior to starting to use\nHudson? If so, what system was VisFleet using and what compelled the switch\nto\nHudson?</td></tr></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Rasheed</strong></td><td>We didn&#8217;t actually, but certainly everyone I knew who was doing continuous\nintegration recommended Hudson.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><br></br></td></tr></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><tr><td align=\"center\"><strong>Hudson</strong></td><td>That&#8217;s good to hear! How lucky you are to know so many smart people :)<br></br><br></br>\nWhat kinds of projects is VisFleet building with Hudson?</td></tr></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Rasheed</strong></td><td>We build and test Ruby On Rails service layer applications. We also build <a id=\"aptureLink_hbiB8O3Dwj\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe%20Flex\">Flex</a> applications using the Flex SDK for our web-deployed RIA offering. Lastly, we build our iPhone applications using Hudson.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><br></br></td></tr></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><tr><td align=\"center\"><strong>Hudson</strong></td><td>I&#8217;d say building and testing web applications alone with Hudson would be quite notable, but to add Flex and iPhone applications into the mix as well is certainly interesting! Anything specific that&#8217;s interesting about VisFleet&#8217;s use of Hudson?</td></tr></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Rasheed</strong></td><td>It runs multiple agent types, and automates deploys to different cloud\ninfrastructures. At the moment we have 2 Flex build agents running Ubuntu, A\nMac Mini building our iPhone app, and several Ubuntu Servers testing our web\ntier. We currently deploy to Citrix Xen servers, and soon to <a id=\"aptureLink_Xq08IAbEb1\" href=\"https://twitter.com/RackCloud\">Rackspace Cloud</a> as well.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nIn the near future, we will automate integration by first updating an\nintegration system on the cloud, deploying our system and then running our\ntests. All very quickly.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nWe have very little metric and reporting output from Hudson, and this is\nnoteworthy in it&#8217;s absence. It&#8217;s very important  to use to provide clear\ndevelopment metrics and integrate those into our <a id=\"aptureLink_ZAd2AShPj0\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum%20%28development%29\">Scrum</a>/<a id=\"aptureLink_U9x9KuaN08\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban\">Kanban</a> approach. What\nHudson has done for us is educate us about the possibilities in\nvisualisation and reporting, and is informing the way we structure our\ncodebase going forward. Soon, we expect to have a premium test driven\ndevelopment environment and workflow.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><br></br></td></tr></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><tr><td align=\"center\"><strong>Hudson</strong></td><td>We all know Hudson isn&#8217;t perfect but there&#8217;s a lot of room for extending it to meet your demands if need be, what additional tools have you written to glue everything together behind\nthe scenes?</td></tr></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Rasheed</strong></td><td>We are using '<a id=\"aptureLink_dcU0BLKBi3\" href=\"https://rubyhitsquad.com/Vlad_the_Deployer.html\">Vlad the Deployer</a>' and in legacy, '<a id=\"aptureLink_CMeh4NNwSI\" href=\"https://www.capify.org/\">Capistrano</a>' for a lot of\nour deployment and build tasks.
