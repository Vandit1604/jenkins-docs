In many cases update to JNLP4 was a resolution</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>JNLP1/JNLP2/CLI1 are unencrypted, and it is not something Jenkins users may expect in 2017</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>It is tracked as <a href=\"https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-45841\">JENKINS-45841</a> in Jenkins JIRA.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_how\">How?</h3>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When Jenkins is started in the new installation mode with enabled Installation Wizard, old protocols will be disabled</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jenkins shows an administrative warning when obsolete protocols are enabled</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_compatibility_notes\">Compatibility notes</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Older instances won&#8217;t be affected by the disabling of the older JNLP1/JNLP2 protocols, which will still be enabled for them.\nNewly created instances which skip, or disable, the Setup Wizard will not be affected either.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>\"New\" Jenkins instances installed via setup wizard <strong>may be affected</strong> in edge cases. For example:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Agents with Remoting older than 3.0 will be unable to connect.</p>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Before updating make sure Remoting is not bundled custom Docker images, AMIs, etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Swarm Plugin: old versions of Swarm Client (before 3.3) will be unable to connect to Jenkins, because Remoting 2.x is bundled</p>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>: Update Swarm Client</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Very</strong> old jenkins-cli.jar without CLI2 support will be unable to connect.</p>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>: Do not use Remoting-based CLI on new instances (see <a href=\"/blog/2017/04/11/new-cli/\">this

class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Starting with version 2.54, Jenkins requires Java 8 to run\n(<a href=\"/blog/2017/04/10/jenkins-has-upgraded-to-java-8/\">announcement blog post</a>).\nThis version is also required for Jenkins LTS 2.60.1.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Remoting continued to support Java 7 for a while for backporting purposes,\nbut it will be also upgraded to Java 8 in the Remoting 3.11 release.\nThis Rremoting version is expected to be available in Jenkins 2.75 (ETA: Aug 20, 2017).\nThis change is tracked as <a href=\"https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-43985\">JENKINS-43985</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_compatibility_notes_2\">Compatibility notes</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The update does not cause compatibility issues in common use-cases.\nHowever, there may be issues in custom Jenkins core builds and packaging.\nThere are several examples below.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Jenkins instances with built-in Remoting versions will <strong>NOT</strong> be affected, Java 8 is already required

there</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Custom</strong> Jenkins WAR file builds targeting Java 7 may fail to build/run if they bundle Remoting 3.11 or later</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Custom</strong> Jenkins agent instances (manually installed hosts, VM snapshots, Docker packages, AMIs, etc.) may fail if they download the latest Remoting version and use Java 7</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_java_9_support\">Java 9 support</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As with Jenkins core, Java 9 <strong>not supported</strong> and <strong>not tested</strong> in Remoting.\nIt may work in some configurations, but it is not guaranteed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As a consequence, it is not recommended to run Remoting with Java 9 right now.\nIt is also not recommended to use <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/maven-plugin\">Maven Integration Plugin</a> to run builds on Java 9.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_whats_next\">What&#8217;s next?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>There are some ongoing
