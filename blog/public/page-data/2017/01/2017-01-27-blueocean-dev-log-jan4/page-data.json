This week was 10 steps forward, and about 1.5 backwards&#8230;&#8203;</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>There were two releases this week, <code>b19</code> and <code>b20</code>. Unfortunately, <code>b20</code> had to\nbe released shortly after <code>b19</code> hit the Update Center as an incompatible API\nchange in a 3rd party plugin was discovered.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Regardless, the latest <code>b20</code> has a <strong>lot</strong> of important improvements, and some\nvery nice new features.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image center\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/blueocean-dev-log/pipeline-creation-flow.png\" alt=\"Creating a Pipeline in Blue Ocean\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A first cut of the \"Create Pipeline\" UX, seen above, allowing you to create Git\nbased <a href=\"/doc/book/pipeline/multibranch/\">Multibranch Pipelines</a> like you have never seen before.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Handling network disconnections from the browser to server (eg server\nrestart, network etc) gracefully with a nice UI.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More precise time information for steps and running Pipelines.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More information when a Pipeline is blocked on infrastructure, such as when\nthe Pipeline is waiting for an agent to become available.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a really embarrassing typo (a prize if you spot it).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Test reports now include stdout and stderr</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Better support for parallel visualisation, such as when a <code>parallel</code> step exists outside of a stage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Visual Editor also had another release, with the \"sheets\" visual component\nand better validation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_creation\">Creation</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Currently this is hidden behind a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle\">feature toggle</a>,\nto access append <code>?blueCreate</code> to the URL in you browser, and then press the\n\"New Pipeline\" button. Currently it lets you quickly create a Pipeline from\nGit, add credentials, etc, in a very nice UX. More SCM types are being added to\nsupport this.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_reconnectdisconnect\">Reconnect/disconnect</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image center\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/blueocean-dev-log/connection-lost.png\" alt=\"Lost connection\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As Blue Ocean is a very \"live\" style of UX, if your network becomes\nunavailable, or the server is restarted, it is good to know in case you\nwere staring at the screen waiting for something to happen (don&#8217;t you have\nanything better to do??). When this happens, now you get a polite message,\nand then when the connection is restored, even if you are waiting for a\nPipeline run to finish, it will then notice this, and refresh things for\nyou:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image center\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/blueocean-dev-log/connection-ok.png\" alt=\"Reconnected\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Note the opacity changes to make it clear even if you don&#8217;t see the little\nmessage.
