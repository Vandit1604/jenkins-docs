The conference will be\nheld from <strong>September 13th to 15th</strong> in Santa Clara, California and is being\norganized and sponsored in part by <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com\">CloudBees</a>.\nJust like the \"Jenkins User Conferences\" before it, this year&#8217;s event will\nfeature many experts from the Jenkins community that help make Jenkins\nthe most popular open source automation server on the planet. We&#8217;ve found that\nwe outgrew the popular multi-city one-day Jenkins User Conferences, so unlike\nprevious years Jenkins World will be a three-day event in one place with an\nincredible amount of great content.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The goal of the event is to bring Jenkins contributors and users of all levels\ntogether, from around the world, to discuss, share and learn from one another.\nStarting <em>today</em> we&#8217;re opening the\n<strong><a href=\"https://jenkins-cfp.herokuapp.com/events/jenkins-world-2016\">call for\nproposals</a></strong>.
