This is\nwhere our problems happen.  The default Java garbage collection algorithm\n(ParallelGC) pauses everything when it has to collect garbage (often called a\n\"stop the world pause\"). During that period, Jenkins is fully halted: normally\n(with small heaps) these pauses are too brief to be an issue.  With heaps of 4\nGB or larger, the time required becomes long enough to be a problem: several\nseconds over short windows, and over a longer interval you occasionally see\nmuch longer pauses (tens of seconds, or minutes.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This is where the user-visible hangs and lock-ups happen.  It also adds\nsignificant latency to those build/deploy tasks.  In periods of heavy load, the\nsystem was even experiencing hangs of 30+ seconds for a single full GC cycle.\nThis was long enough to trigger network timeouts (or internal Jenkins thread\ntimeouts) and cause even larger problems.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Fortunately there&#8217;s a solution: the concurrent low-pause garbage collection\nalgorithms, Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) and Garbage First (G1). These attempt\nto do much of the garbage collection concurrently with application threads,\nresulting in much shorter pauses (at a slight cost in extra CPU use).  We&#8217;re\ngoing to focus on G1, because it is slated to become the default in Java 9 and\nis the official recommendation for large heap sizes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s see what happens when someone uses G1 on a similarly-sized Jenkins\ncontroller with Instance B (17 GB heap):</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Their settings:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>16 GB max heap, 0.5 GB initial size</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Java flags (mostly defaults, except for G1): <code>-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseCompressedClassPointers -XX:+UseCompressedOops</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>And the GC log analysis:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/gc-tuning/s-duration-company-b-g1.png\" alt=\"Instance B Jenkins G1 duration\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Key stats:</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Throughput: 98.76%  (not great, but still only slowing things down a bit)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Average GC time: 128 ms</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GC cycles over 2 seconds: 11, 0.27%</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Minor/Full GC average time: 122 ms / 1 sec 232 ms</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Object creation &amp; promotion rate: 132.53 MB/s &amp; 522 KB/s</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Okay, <strong>much better</strong>: some improvement may be expected from a 30% smaller\nheap, but not as much as we&#8217;ve seen.  Most of the GC pauses are well\nunder 2 seconds, but we have 11 outliers - long Full GC pauses of 2-12 seconds.\nThose are troubling; we&#8217;ll take a deeper dive into their causes in a second.\nFirst, let&#8217;s look at the big picture and at how Jenkins behaves with G1 GC for\na second instance.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>G1 Garbage Collection with Instance C (24 GB heap):</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Their settings:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>24 GB max heap, 24 GB initial heap, 2 GB max metaspace</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some custom flags: `-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:+UseStringDeduplication  -XX:+UseCompressedClassPointers -XX:+UseCompressedOops `</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Clearly they&#8217;ve done some garbage collection tuning and optimization.  The\nAlwaysPreTouch pre-zeros allocated heap pages, rather than waiting until\nthey&#8217;re first used. This is suggested especially for large heap sizes, because\nit trades slightly slower startup times for improved runtime performance.  Note\nalso that they pre-allocated the whole heap.  This is a common optimization.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>They also enabled StringDeduplication, a G1 option introduced in Java 8 Update\n20 that transparently replaces identical character arrays with pointers to the\noriginal, reducing memory use (and improving cache performance).  Think of it\nlike <code>String.intern()</code> but it silently happens during garbage collection.  This\nis a concurrent operation added on to normal GC cycles, so it doesn&#8217;t pause the\napplication.  We&#8217;ll look at its impacts later.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Looking at the basics:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/gc-tuning/s-duration-company-c-g1.png\" alt=\"Instance C G1 duration\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Similar picture to Instance B, but it&#8217;s hidden by the sheer number of points\n(this is a longer period here, 1 month).

Instance B had 11\nsuper-long pause outliers.  Let&#8217;s get some more detail, by opening GC Logs in\n<a href=\"https://github.com/chewiebug/GCViewer\">GCViewer</a>.\nThis tool gives a tremendous amount of information.

For concurrent garbage collectors, there\nare actually 3 modes: young GC, concurrent GC, and full GC.  Concurrent GC\nreplaces the Full GC mode in Parallel GC with a faster concurrent operation\nthat runs in parallel with the application.  But in a few cases, we are\nforced to fall back to a non-concurrent Full GC operation, which will use the\nserial  (single-threaded) garbage collector.  That means that even if we have\n30+ CPU cores, only one is working. This is what is happening here, and on a\nlarge-heap, multicore system it is S  L  O  W.  How slow?  280 MB/s vs. 12487\nMB/s for Instance B (for instance C, the difference is also about 50:1).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>What triggers a full GC instead of concurrent:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Explicit calls to <code>System.gc()</code>  (most common culprit, often tricky to trace down)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Metadata GC Threshold: Metaspace (used for Class data mostly) has hit the\ndefined size to force garbage collection or increase it.

For Jenkins on this hardware, this appears to work\n<strong>just fine</strong> and a rare longer pause is OK as long as they don&#8217;t get too\nbig.  Also remember, if this happens often, G1 GC will try to autotune for\nlower pauses and more predictable performance.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_a_few_final_settings\">A Few Final Settings</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We mentioned StringDeduplication was on with Instance C, what is the impact?\nThis only triggers on Strings that have survived a few generations (most of our\ngarbage does not), has limits on the CPU time it can use, and replaces\nduplicate references to their immutable backing character arrays.\n<a href=\"https://java-performance.info/java-string-deduplication/\">For more info, look here</a>.\nSo, we should be trading a little CPU time for improved memory efficiently\n(similarly to string interning).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>At the beginning, this has a huge impact:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>[GC concurrent-string-deduplication, 375.3K-&gt;222.5K(152.8K), avg 63.0%, 0.0     024966 secs]\n[GC concurrent-string-deduplication, 4178.8K-&gt;965.5K(3213.2K), avg 65.3%, 0     .0272168 secs]\n[GC concurrent-string-deduplication, 36.1M-&gt;9702.6K(26.6M), avg 70.3%, 0.09     65196 secs]\n[GC concurrent-string-deduplication, 4895.2K-&gt;394.9K(4500.3K), avg 71.9%, 0     .0114704 secs]</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This peaks at an average of about ~90%:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After running for a month, less of an impact - many of the strings that can be\ndeduplicated already are:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>[GC concurrent-string-deduplication, 138.7K-&gt;39.3K(99.4K), avg 68.2%, 0.0007080 secs]\n[GC concurrent-string-deduplication, 27.3M-&gt;21.5M(5945.1K), avg 68.1%, 0.0554714 secs]\n[GC concurrent-string-deduplication, 304.0K-&gt;48.5K(255.5K), avg 68.1%, 0.0021169 secs]\n[GC concurrent-string-deduplication, 748.9K-&gt;407.3K(341.7K), avg 68.1%, 0.0026401 secs]\n[GC concurrent-string-deduplication, 3756.7K-&gt;663.1K(3093.6K), avg 68.1%, 0.0270676 secs]\n[GC concurrent-string-deduplication, 974.3K-&gt;17.0K(957.3K), avg 68.1%, 0.0121952 secs]</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>However it&#8217;s cheap to use: in average, each dedup cycle takes 8.8 ms and\nremoves 2.4 kB of duplicates.

A small change per cycle, but in aggregate it adds up\nquickly&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in periods of heavy load, this can save hundreds of megabytes of\ndata. But that&#8217;s still small, relative to multi-GB heaps.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Conclusion: turn string deduplication on</strong> string deduplication is fairly\ncheap to use, and reduces the steady-state memory needed for Jenkins.  That\nfrees up more room for the young generation, and should overall reduce GC time\nby removing duplicate objects.  I think it&#8217;s worth turning on.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Soft reference flushing:</strong> Jenkins uses soft references for caching build\nrecords and in pipeline FlowNodes.  The only guarantee for these is that they\nwill be removed instead of causing an OutOfMemoryError&#8230;&#8203; however Java\napplications can slow to a crawl from memory pressure long before that happens.\nThere&#8217;s an option that provides a hint to the JVM based on time &amp; free memory,\ncontrolled by <code>-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB</code> (default 1000).  The SoftReferences\nbecome eligible for garbage collection after this many milliseconds have\nelapsed since last touch&#8230;&#8203; per MB of unused heap (vs the maximum).  The\nreferenced objects don&#8217;t count towards that target.  So, with 10 GB of heap\nfree and the default 1000 ms setting, soft references stick around for ~2.8\nhours (!).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If the system is continuously allocating more soft references, it may trigger\nheavy GC activity, rather than clearing out soft references. See the open bug\n<a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6912889\">JDK-6912889</a>\nfor more details.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If Jenkins consumes excessive old generation memory, it <strong>may</strong> help to make soft\nreferences easier to flush  by reducing -XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB from its\ndefault (1000) to something smaller (say 10-200).  The catch is that\nSoftReferences are often used for objects that are relatively expensive to\nload, such lazy-loaded build records and pipeline FlowNode data.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_caveats\">Caveats</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>G1 vs. CMS:</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>G1 was available on later releases of JRE 7, but unstable and slow.</strong>  If you\nuse it you absolutely must be using JRE 8, and the later the release the better\n(it&#8217;s gotten a lot of patches).  Googling around will show horrible G1 vs CMS\nbenchmarks from around 2014: these are probably best ignored, since the G1\nimplementation was still immature then. There&#8217;s probably a niche for CMS use\nstill, especially on midsized heaps (1-3 GB) or where settings are already\ntuned.  With appropriate tuning it <strong>can</strong> still perform generally well for\nJenkins (which mostly generates short-lived garbage), but CMS eventually suffer\nfrom heap fragmentation and need a slow, non-concurrent Full GC to clear this.\nIt also needs considerably more tuning than G1.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>General GC tuning caveats</strong>:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>No single setting is perfect for everybody.

The only setting that jumps out as a likely candidate\nfor further tuning is G1 region size (too small and there are many humungous\nobject allocations, which hurt performance).
