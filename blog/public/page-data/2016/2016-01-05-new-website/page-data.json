Like Jenkins itself, Drupal is easy to set up, install\nplugins and authoring content is done in a web UI. For the past seven years Drupal\nhas served us well, but it is time to move on to something better suited for our needs.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The general requirements for something newer were:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p>Easy to edit and create content</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Changes to content should be tracked and reviewable</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any Jenkins contributor should be able to participate</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Support mixed content types</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The consensus was that a statically-generated site, with raw content hosted on\nGitHub, would meet the majority of the \"ease-of-use\" type requirements. The\nremainder could be addressed depending on the implementation. A couple of years\nago I tried to rebuild the site with static content using\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll\">Jekyll</a>, commonly used by\n<a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a>, but the effort stalled as I ran\ninto challenges with the mixture of content types we need to manage (stories,\nevents, pages, people, etc).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Having recently discovered <a href=\"http://awestruct.org/\">Awestruct</a>, a more\nversatile and sophisticated static-site generator that powers sites like\n<a href=\"https://asciidoctor.org\">asciidoctor.org</a>, I ventured down that path.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To make a long story short, over the holiday break I finally pulled the trigger\nand switched <code>jenkins-ci.org</code> over to the new site. In fact, the page you&#8217;re\nreading <strong>right now</strong> was authored and published via our new\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io\">jenkins static site</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you look at the bottom left-hand corner of this page\nthere is a link titled \"Improve this page\" which will take you directly to\nGitHub to edit this post!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We have many more improvements to come for the Jenkins website, which are\n<a href=\"https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&amp;projectKey=WEBSITE\">tracked\nin JIRA</a>, but for now I invite members of the Jenkins community to help curate,\ncorrect and create new blog posts and pages for <code>jenkins-ci.org</code>!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io\">Check it all out on GitHub</a></p>\n</div>","document":{"title":"A new Jenkins website","main":"A new Jenkins website"},"author":{"fullName":"---"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"9cebc947-aabc-5745-8a5e-ea16ee8e0c22"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
