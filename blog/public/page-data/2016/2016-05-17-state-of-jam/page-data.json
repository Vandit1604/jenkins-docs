This has been a major milestone for\nJenkins and its growing community of developers, testers, designers and other\nusers in the software delivery process.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>With its rising popularity and wide adoption, the Jenkins community continues to\ngrow and evolve into the millions. Jenkins community meetup activity has risen\nto an all time high since the first Jenkins meetup which was established on\nAugust 23 2010, in San Francisco.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Over the last six months the number of\n<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/jenkins/\">Jenkins Area Meetup (JAM) Groups</a> has\ngrown from 5 to 30, with coverage in Asia, North America, South America and\nEurope.  That’s an average growth of <strong>4 new JAMs per month</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/post-images/state-of-jam-2016/JAM-map.png\" alt=\"JAM map\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As of today, there are over <strong>4,100</strong> Jenkins fans within the Jenkins meetup\ncommunity.  This is the result of contributions from community JAM leaders who\nhave volunteered their time to provide a platform for learning, sharing and\nnetworking all things Jenkins within their local communities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For anyone who has not organized a meetup before, there are many moving parts\nthat have to come together at a specific location, date and time. This process\ntakes significant effort to methodically plan out. From planning the food and\nbeverages to securing speaker(s), a venue, audio/visual setup, technical\nlogistics and of course promoting the meetup. It does takes a level of passion\nand effort to make it all happen.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Many <strong>THANKS</strong> to the <strong>55</strong> JAM leaders, who share this passion - they have\nsuccessfully organized over <strong>41</strong> meetups within the past six months in North\nAmerica, South America and Europe. That’s about 6 meetups a month!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/post-images/state-of-jam-2016/JAMs-over-time.png\" alt=\"JAMs over time\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>There are still plenty of opportunities to be a JAM organizer.
